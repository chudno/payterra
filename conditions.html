                <p>7.5.When submitting a Transaction to us, you agree to the applicable Card Scheme Rules with respect to the Transactions in question. We will forward the submitted Transaction to the appropriate Card Scheme.

                7.7.9.you have reached any transaction limits agreed with you or imposed on you by us; or<br>
                7.7.10.any security you provided to us has or will become insufficient to cover all claims we may have against you under this Agreement.</p>

                <p>7.8.If you allow a price adjustment, return of merchandise, or cancellation of goods or services in connection with a Settled or Submitted Transaction, you will prepare and deliver to us Transaction Data reflecting such refund or adjustment within 3 days of receiving the Cardholder’s request for such refund or adjustment.

You are not allowed to accept cash or any other payment or consideration from a Cardholder in return for preparing a refund to be deposited to the Cardholder’s account; nor may you give cash refunds to a Cardholder in connection with a Settled or Submitted Transaction, unless permitted or required by law.</p>

                8.5.1.any Transaction Data is incomplete or incorrect;<br>

                <p>9.7.In case the Balance Deductibles exceed your available Merchant Payment Account Balance, we may at our discretion determine which Balance Deductibles shall be deducted to which extent from your Merchant Payment Account Balance. The remainder of the Balance Deductibles may either be debited from your Merchant Payment Account (resulting in a negative Merchant Payment Account Balance) or may be otherwise collected from you as set out in clause 10.2 or by one or more of the following:<br>
                9.7.1.demand from you immediate payment including but not limited to engaging a debt collection agency or commencing legal action;<br>

                <h2>10. Settlement and Settlement Account</h2>

                <p>10.1.In order to receive funds from your Merchant Payment Account, you are required to open and maintain a bank account at a credit institution of your choice, provided that (a) this credit institution is a member of a recognised payments clearing and settlement system and that (b) we have not rejected your chosen bank account within reasonable time of your application. Depending on the nature of your business or where your business is located or your customers are residing, we may impose restrictions on where you must hold the relevant bank account. You must communicate to us such details of your bank account as we may reasonably require to settle funds into this account (and any such designated account shall be your “Settlement Account”). You must give us at least 10 days’ notice of any changes to your Settlement Account. You may only close your current Settlement Account if you provide us with details of a new account that you designate as your new Settlement Account. You are solely liable for all fees and costs associated with your Settlement Account.</p>

                <p>10.2. Within 10 business days after the end of every Reporting Period we shall transfer the Merchant Payment Account Balance on the end of the Reporting Period (but no more than the current balance less Reserve amount) to your Settlement Account (a “Settlement Payment”). We shall ensure that a Settlement Payment reaches the credit institution where your Settlement Account is held on the next business day following the business day on which we start to process your request, however, we are not responsible for the time that these funds are credited to your Settlement Account as this is the responsibility of your credit institution.
                Any Settlement payment which is overdue for the term for then one month due to your fault shall accrue interest in an amount of 10% plus the then current six months EIBOR rate.
                If the currency of your Merchant Payment Account is not the same as the currency of your Settlement Account, we will convert Settlement Payment at our internal exchange rate due the FX costs.
                We may suspend Settlement Payment due to anti-money laundering reasons.</p>

                <p>10.3.Instead of deducting the Balance Deductibles from your Merchant Payment Account Balance, we may in our sole discretion debit the Settlement Account with all or party of any Balance Deductibles by direct debit or otherwise collect such amounts from you; for this purpose, we may request that you give us and maintain for our benefit a direct debit mandate over your Settlement Account for any amounts owed by you to us. You must ensure that your Settlement Account at all times holds a sufficient balance that any direct debit we reasonably make is covered and not returned due to insufficient funds.</p>

                <p>10.4. We shall send you the Act for services rendered (hereinafter the "Act") by email or share it in your Merchant portal no later than the fifteenth day of the month following the reporting month. In the case that no Transactions were executed during the reporting period, we are entitled not to provide an Act upon your request.</p>

                <p>10.5. If within three calendar days from the date of receipt of the Act you do not send your objections, the respective services are considered to be rendered in full and in a proper manner.</p>

                <p>10.7. We may provide the original of the Act in case of receipt of the signed original Act from you.</p>

                <p>10.8. In case if you receive a signed original of the Act, you must send us one signed original of the Act within three working days of the receipt of the Act.</p>

                <p>10.9. The provisions of this paragraph 10 apply, unless otherwise provided by Service Agreement Fee Schedule.</p>

                <p>11.1.At any time during this Agreement and for a period of up to thirteen months after the termination of this Agreement, we may temporarily suspend or delay payments to you and/or designate in our discretion an amount of funds that we maintain in order to protect us against the risk of actual or anticipated Chargebacks or otherwise against the risk of your actual or anticipated failure to meet your obligations under this Agreement or relevant Card Scheme Rules or APM Rules (such funds, in whatever form given or maintained, hereinafter referred to as the “Reserve Amount”) as stated in paragraph 5 of the Agreement.</p>

                <p>11.2.Immediately upon request, you are required to pay us sufficient funds to cover the Reserve Amount and failure to do so entitles us to take any of the actions outlined in clause 9.7 or to debit your Settlement Account with all or part of the Reserve Amount under a direct debit mandate you may have given us over your Settlement Account or, as part of a security, over any other bank or payment account.</p>

                <p>11.3.The Reserve Amount shall at all times consist of sufficient funds to cover any unbilled service fees plus our estimated exposure based on reasonable criteria for Chargebacks, returns, unshipped merchandise or other claims of Cardholders, Card Issuers, APM Users or APM Providers against you and any liabilities imposed on us by the Card Schemes.</p>

                <p>11.4.We may (but are not required to) apply funds in the Reserve Amount toward, and set off any funds that would otherwise be payable to you against the satisfaction of any amounts which are or may become due from you under or in connection with this Agreement.</p>

                <p>11.5.You will have no legal right or interest in the funds in the Reserve Amount; provided, however, that upon satisfaction of all of your obligations under this Agreement, we will pay to you any funds then remaining in the Reserve Amount. In this case, the Reserve Amount represents a monetary claim against us. Under no circumstances shall the Reserve Amount be deemed to constitute a deposit or otherwise a repayable sum held by us on your behalf.</p>

                <p>11.6.Effective upon the establishment of a Reserve Amount, you irrevocably grant to us a security interest in any interest you may now have or later acquire in any and all funds, together with the proceeds thereof, that may at any time be in our possession and would otherwise be payable to you pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to execute and deliver to us such instruments and documents (including, without limitation, direct debit mandates, legal charges, security deposits, guarantees and other security arrangements) that we may reasonably request to establish, confirm, maintain, use or realise the security interests and rights of set-off set forth in this Agreement.</p>
